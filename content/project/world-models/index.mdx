In this project, we applied the World Models Deep Learning Framework
to an Arcade Game Space Invaders.

World Models is a Deep Learning framework which trains a network much
like how a human learns about the world, by focussing on the idea of
cultivating a model's internal mental model of their environment such
that the model can train using it's own imagination.

My specific section was training Mixed Density Recurrent Neural
Network to predict the next game state and action.
