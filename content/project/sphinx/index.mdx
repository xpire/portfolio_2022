In this project, I built a full-stack implementation of a password
manager referenced by the sphinx white paper, based on Elliptic Curve
Cryptography.

Sphinx stands for "a password Store that Perfectly Hides from Itself
(No eXaggeration!)". It is a novel implementation of a password store
which
> remains secure even when the password manager itself has been compromised.

Sphinx relies on device-enhanced password authenticated key exchange,
by storing part of the password on an external device, such that an
attacker breaking into this device learns no information about the
master password or the userâ€™s individual passwords.

I created an Interactive Python Jupyter Notebook containing my
implementation of core algorithms: Octet String to Integer Primitives,
HashToBase function, Simple SWU Hashing algorithm, Oblivious
Pseudo-Random Function and an API flask server for backend.

I also completed a mathematically complete implementation of the above
functions in JavaScript with sjcl.js for front-end cryptographic
capability and a fully featured React.js front-end chrome extension
providing full user experience for MVP.

A live demo of the chrome extension can be found in the live section.
