A group of my friends got into the fighting game, Guilty Gear, and we wanted to buy
some proper arcade controllers. However we had all gotten used to keyboard controls, 
including the left shift which is normally not found in fight sticks you can order online.

Thus, we decided to build our own one from existing open source projects. I used KiCad to 
edit the PCB to use full MX switches, and added an extra button for the left shift. I then 
mocked layers in blender to build a clean acrylic case. We borrowed a friend's uncle's CNC 
machine and cut the layers. Images of the process and results can be found in the git.

My main role was editing the PCB, and mocking up the acrylic layers for the case. We learnt a lot
in this process, from the engineering need for tolerances, to how CNCs work, how smart PCB wiring
can be to support multiple orientations of switches and how arduinos are programmed.
