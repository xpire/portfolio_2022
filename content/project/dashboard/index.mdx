A group of my friends got obsessed with this discord game called Daisuki, where you collect
anime characters with rolls and there was an indepth points system. We got so obsessed that 
the need for a dashboard to truly show who was winning had become apparent, so Lucas and I 
decided to work on a frontend SPA that hits the discord bot, gathers all the leaderboard data, and plots it in a pretty fashion. I bootstrapped the frontend in this project.
