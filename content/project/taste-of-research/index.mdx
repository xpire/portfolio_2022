In this project, I was tasked with cleaning hundreds of spoken
excerpts of Dementia Patients' speech data.

The structure of the recordings was a sequence of words spoken with
large gaps between each word, with the occasional remark from the
interviewer. For such a seemingly simplistic problem, many existing
silence detecting solutions I tried did not work. Hence, I decided to
build my own, and also explore how silence detection works.

I used the python package `librosa` to conduct the audio
analysis. Through my experimentations with this Jupyter Notebook, I
fixed DC offsets and used the RMS of the audio signal to calculate
when noise occured to detect the silences.
