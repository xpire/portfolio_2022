In this project, we created a full stack investment simulator game. Users 
create an account, login and can start trading on the real stock exchange 
using simulator currency. We track their portfolio's profit and loss, and 
have gamified the experience with a level system where new features and hints
are unlocked as they continue playing. A live leaderboard shows who the top 
contestants are and there is quite a lot of depth.

I mainly worked on the entire frontend of the application, from designing all
the pages, developing all the UI elements used, and serving it statically to clients as a SPA.

We had both a backend DB for more ingrained data storage, as well as firebase for handling login,
password resets and general account storage.
