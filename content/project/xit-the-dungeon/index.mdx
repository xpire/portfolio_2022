In this project, we created a dungeon crawler game, combining
exploration with combat and creativity.

The game was inspired by the creative modes of Super Mario Maker with
the Dungeon aspect of old 2d turn based games. Throughout the project,
my team and I honed our Git and Java skills in one of the first full
scale teamwork projects ever.

I wrote the AI for the enemies, from simple shortest path finding to
implementing an iterative page-rank algorithm to simulate a markov
chain of the user's moves. I also was in charge of the animations of
all sprites and the sound system.
